# HealthCare-System
## Overview
HealthCare-System is an online treatment platform that connects doctors and users. Users can apply for doctor profiles, which are then reviewed by admins through interviews. Upon approval, doctors can offer their services on the platform. Users can select appointment times with doctors, and once these appointments are approved by the doctors, they can provide treatments and prescriptions, thereby completing the userâ€™s treatment.
